# file-shuffler
Electron-app to shuffle files in a folder by prefixing their names with a random number

As already mentioned above, this file-shuffler-app is just a small little electron-application which reads in any number of files of a directory and concatenates their filenames with random numbers. The goal was for stupid little usb-drives used with own music on car radios to have a shuffled playlist every now and then, in case the car-radio itself doesn't support that feature.
